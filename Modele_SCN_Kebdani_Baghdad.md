# SCN Model â€“ Spirituo-Cardio-Neurology

## Author: Kebdani Baghdad

This repository introduces the SCN Model, an integrative framework connecting **spiritual**, **cardiological**, and **neurological** domains.

### Objectives
- To explore the correlation between Islamic spiritual practices and neurocardiac coherence.
- To validate the SCN approach through psychophysiological indicators.

### Methodology
- Quranic recitation and guided dhikr (remembrance) as spiritual stimuli.
- Heart rate variability (HRV) and EEG data as physiological indicators.

### Results (Summary)
- Significant increase in HRV coherence.
- Enhanced neuro-cardio-synchronization during spiritual practice.
- Participant-reported stress reduction and elevated focus.

### Perspective
This model opens pathways for Islamic-based therapeutic strategies and provides a scientific lens for the psycho-spiritual benefits of faith practices.
